"""The DISCOVER ⇄ RESOLVE turn handler (§11.1).

Everything Phase 4 built, in the order one turn actually needs it:

1. **Safety** (§16.1). Before anything else, and it returns without reaching the
   model at all. A cached script and a transfer, never generated text.
2. **Intent** (§11.2). Rules first, so a request for a human works when the
   gateway does not.
3. **Escalation** (§12). Evaluated *before* generation, because §12.1's
   immediate triggers mean "no further agent turns" -- generating an answer and
   then discarding it would spend a turn's latency proving the transfer was
   right.
4. **Tools** (§6.3). At most two, in parallel where independent.
5. **Context** (§6.2), then **generation** (§6.1), then **validation** (§16.3).

The ordering is the design. Each step can end the turn, and the ones that can
end it most consequentially come first -- so the cheapest path through this
function is also the most urgent one.

:class:`Agent` satisfies the ``Responder`` protocol the Phase 2 pipeline already
takes, which is why the timing machinery needed no changes: the seam was put
there for this.

        Waiting for the complete answer before speaking any of it costs the

        token at ~1.7 s and a full 35-word Hindi answer several seconds after
        that, none of which reaches the caller until the last token lands. The
        first sentence is usually finished long before.

        **Why this is safe, when the previous note here said it was not.**
        §16.3's validator is local, stateless and its rules are *monotonic* --
        register, guarantees, filler and grounding all fail on the offending
        sentence and cannot be redeemed by a later one. Crucially the tool
        results it grounds against are complete before generation starts, so a
        sentence can be grounded the moment it is complete. Only the word cap
        is cumulative, and that is checked cumulatively.

        Two rules keep the parts that are genuinely not decomposable intact:

        **A dosage answer is never streamed.** §16.2 requires the dose, the
        pre-harvest interval and the precaution to be spoken together. Speaking
        the dose and then stopping because a later sentence failed is the one
        outcome worse than being slow.

        **The first sentence is spoken only after it validates**, which keeps
        §16.3's retry available in the common failure case: nothing has been
        said yet, so a bad opening is regenerated with feedback exactly as
        before. Once speech has started it cannot be recalled, so a later
        failure stops there and hands over -- a partial true answer plus a
